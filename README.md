# Network Security Home Lab

This repository contains my **Network Security Home Lab** assignments, where I explore, configure, and secure an Ubuntu server.  

Each lab is documented as a separate "chapter" in markdown format. The goal of this repo is to:
- Demonstrate hands-on network security skills
- Build a portfolio for cybersecurity job applications
- Show step-by-step exploration of tools and configurations in Ubuntu
